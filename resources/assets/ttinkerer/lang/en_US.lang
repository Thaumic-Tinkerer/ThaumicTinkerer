# -- COMPUTERCRAFT PERIPHERALS
ttresearch.name.PERIPHERALS=Computercraft Peripherals
ttresearch.lore.PERIPHERALS=When technology meets magic
ttresearch.page.PERIPHERALS.0=Thaumic Tinkerer allows for some of the blocks that it adds, alongside some vanilla Thaumcraft blocks, to be used as ComputerCraft peripherals.<BR><BR>For convenience sake, the method documentation for these peripherals is in an external webpage. Pressing ENTER right now will take you to it.
ttresearch.webpage.peripherals=https://github.com/Vazkii/ThaumicTinkerer/wiki/Peripheral-Documentation

# -- SMOKEY QUARTZ
ttresearch.name.DARK_QUARTZ=Smokey Quartz
ttresearch.lore.DARK_QUARTZ=Shadow of the Day
ttresearch.page.DARK_QUARTZ.0=Smokey Quartz is pretty much Quartz, but negative. All regular blocks that can be made with quartz, can also be made with smokey quartz, and they look black.<BR><BR>Smokey Quartz itself can be made with a piece of coal or charcoal for tinting, and a few pieces of regular nether quartz.

# -- TRANSVECTOR INTERFACE
ttresearch.name.INTERFACE=Transvector Interface
ttresearch.lore.INTERFACE=Not affiliated with nyuu
ttresearch.page.INTERFACE.0=The thing is, there's only six sides to a block..." - Direwolf20<BR><BR>Myth = Busted! Your latest construct can be bound to a block in the nearby vacinity. It's sides will mimic the sides of the block selected, and it'll function as an extension. It can accept BuildCraft and IC2 power, items, and liquids, being able to also export the latter two.<BR>[continued]
ttresearch.page.INTERFACE.1=In order to bind an interface to another block, you need to create a special tool to do so. What you call the Transvector Binder should get the job done.<BR><BR>By simply right clicking on the interface followed by right clicking on the target, these two get bound and ready for operation. (Note: buildcraft pipes need to be broken and replaced to work)

# -- GASEOUS ILLUMINAE
ttresearch.name.GASEOUS_LIGHT=Gaseous Illuminae
ttresearch.lore.GASEOUS_LIGHT=Bright out of sight
ttresearch.page.GASEOUS_LIGHT.0=You have studied the intricacies of the light, and found out a way to create completely invisible light by infusing a phial with the raw light.<BR><BR>This phial contains a concentrated extract of Gaseous Illuminae, that can be released through a right click, and will spread relatively fast in the nearby area, lighting it up.

# -- GASEOUS TENEBRAE
ttresearch.name.GASEOUS_SHADOW=Gaseous Tenebrae
ttresearch.lore.GASEOUS_SHADOW=The unseen world
ttresearch.page.GASEOUS_SHADOW.0=You have studied the intricacies of the Shadow, and found out a way to create gaseous darkness by infusing a phial with the raw shadow.<BR><BR>This phial contains a concentrated extract of Gaseous Tenebrae, that can be released through a right click, and will spread relatively fast in the nearby area, darkening it.

# -- FUME DISSIPATOR
ttresearch.name.GAS_REMOVER=Fume Dissipator
ttresearch.lore.GAS_REMOVER=Ryuuji's helper
ttresearch.page.GAS_REMOVER.0=After knowing both the Gaseous Illuminae and Tenebrae, you are thinking it's becoming a hassle to get rid of it. With this item, by shift-right clicking on it, all the nearby gas will get dissipated.

# -- SPELLBINDING CLOTH
ttresearch.name.SPELL_CLOTH=Spellbinding Cloth
ttresearch.lore.SPELL_CLOTH=The sad palmtop thaumaturge
ttresearch.page.SPELL_CLOTH.0=By mixing some Enchanted Fabric with raw magic power, you created a cloth that can be rubbed on an item to wipe it of its enchantments by combining them in a Crafting Recipe.

# -- DYNAMISM TABLET
ttresearch.name.ANIMATION_TABLET=Dynamism Tablet
ttresearch.lore.ANIMATION_TABLET=Rosalia's foil
ttresearch.page.ANIMATION_TABLET.0=You decided to further discover the uses of Golem Animation Cores, and this is the fruit of that labour.<BR><BR>This tablet can accept an item to animate with mystical energy. Using the left and right buttons in the tablet's interface, you can select to do a left or right click with the item. The button in the bottom controls if the tablet reacts always when it can or just when a redstone signal is applied.<BR><BR>Virtually anything can be animated, including blocks. The type of tool in the tablet also defines how fast something breaks, as expected.

# -- WAND FOCUS: UPRISING
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_FLIGHT=Wand Focus: Uprising
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_FLIGHT=Is this what they use in ALfheim?
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_FLIGHT.0=Using the knowledge you got from creating the Sword of the Zephyr of propelling things around with air, you created a wand focus that will propel the holder in the direction that they're looking at.<BR><BR>When someone is propelled through the use of this focus, any accumulated gravitational energy is negated, reseting the fall damage the holder would take.

# -- WAND FOCUS: DISLOCATION
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_DISLOCATION=Wand Focus: Dislocation
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_DISLOCATION=Now here, now there
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_DISLOCATION.0=You created a wand focus based on the focus of equal trade. The difference is that this one not only holds the object's fingerprint, but it holds the object itself, allowing it to be placed elsewhere.<BR><BR>To get a block to transport, right click on it. To place it back, right click somewhere else. This focus can transport pretty much anything, including chests and mob spawners.
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_DISLOCATION.1=The vis cost in applied in picking up the block. Placing it down is free.<BR><BR>Due to the amount of energy required for the dislocation, blocks with tile entities (such as chests and furnaces) cost 5x the amount of vis as normally. Mob spawners, in particular, cost 20x instead.

# -- TALISMAN OF REMEDIUM
ttresearch.name.CLEANSING_TALISMAN=Talisman of Remedium
ttresearch.lore.CLEANSING_TALISMAN=Mitsukake's Gift
ttresearch.page.CLEANSING_TALISMAN.0=You have studied life and the body and found that through the application of magic you can protect yourself from harmful outside influences by redirecting these effects to a construct. This talisman will dispell most harmful effects on the holder and keep them on itself, taking damage.<BR><BR>To enable or disable this ability, one would shift-right click on it. As expected, it only works whilst enabled.

# -- HYPERNERGETIC NITOR
ttresearch.name.BRIGHT_NITOR=Hyperenergetic Nitor
ttresearch.lore.BRIGHT_NITOR=Take that, Twilight!
ttresearch.page.BRIGHT_NITOR.0=You managed to create a light that will shine even if it's being carried by a player by energizing the everburning flame that is Nitor with powerful energetic aspects such as Potentia and Lux.<BR><BR>The light casted by this will shine closely behind the carrier, it seems to leave a longer trail in the Nether, due to the heat.

# -- WAND FOCUS: TELEKINESIS
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_TELEKINESIS=Wand Focus: Telekinesis
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_TELEKINESIS=Beats gravity bubbles any day
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_TELEKINESIS.0=You created a wand focus that kinetically moves objects laying on the floor. This focus will move any nearby items to where you're pointing at. Sneaking will bring the items towards you instead.

# -- KINETIC ATTRACTION
ttresearch.name.MAGNETS=Kinetic Attraction
ttresearch.lore.MAGNETS=How do they work?
ttresearch.page.MAGNETS.0=Working with the telekinesis focus, you managed to apply this knowledge to create a device to attract items or living beings, like a magnet.<BR><BR>These two blocks have two states, north (red) and south (blue), in north mode it'll push items, or entities away; in south mode it'll pull them in.
ttresearch.page.MAGNETS.1=You designed two devices. The Kinetic and Corporeal Attractors, these, respectively affect items and living beings.<BR><BR>The Corporeal Attractor involves some more complex mechanisms, to which you can access by right clicking it with a casting wand. Using a Soul Mould, you can right click on a mob to save it as a pattern, which you can set in the attractor's interface, as a filter, along with settings for child or adult animals, if available.

# -- OSMOTIC ENCHANTER
ttresearch.name.ENCHANTER=Osmotic Enchanter
ttresearch.lore.ENCHANTER=Picking your luck
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.0=You grew tired of getting terrible enchantments for your efforts. To that, you created a new enchantment table that allows you to pick what enchantments you want to apply to an item.<BR><BR>This new contraption requires a wand, each enchantment requires a specific combination of vis from that wand. The price of the enchantment is exponentially proportional to the level you want to apply.<BR><BR>Regular enchantment rules apply, for example, you can't combine Silk Touch with Fortune.
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.1=After you selected the enchantments you want on an item, clicking the red button in the interface will start the enchanting progress. As the item is being enchanted, you can't take it out of the table, nor can you change the enchantments you are putting on it.<BR><BR>The table will slowly drain vis from the wand, until it's done. For this to work, there needs to be 6 pillars in the nearby vicinity (4 blocks), these pillars need to be at the same level of the table.<BR><BR>[continued]
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.2=The pillars need to be made of two to twelve Obsidian Totem blocks stacked on top of each other, with a piece of Nitor on top of them. The enchanter will get flux energy from them, grabbing vis from the wand and combining them to enchant the item.

# -- TALISMAN OF WITHHOLD
ttresearch.name.XP_TALISMAN=Talisman of Withhold
ttresearch.lore.XP_TALISMAN=I'll take your 'time'
ttresearch.page.XP_TALISMAN.0=After knowing that Zombie Brains have the ability to store experience, you have created a talisman that mimics that behaviour, not to a perfect extent though.<BR><BR>To switch the ability to store experience, you need to shift-right-click on the talisman. When the talisman is enabled, it'll absorb any nearby experience orbs, those can be transformed back into usable experience by right clicking with a glass bottle in your inventory, turning that bottle into a Bottle o' Enchanting.
