ttresearch.lore.DARK_QUARTZ=Shadow of the Day

It's sides will mimic the sides of the block selected, and it'll function as an extension. It can accept BuildCraft and IC2 power, items, and liquids, being able to also export the latter two.<BR>[continued]
ttresearch.page.INTERFACE.1=In order to bind an interface to another block, you need to create a special tool to do so. What you call the Transvector Binder should get the job done.<BR><BR>By simply right clicking on the interface followed by right clicking on the target, these two get bound and ready for operation. (Note: buildcraft pipes need to be broken and replaced to work)

ttresearch.lore.GAS_REMOVER=Ryuuji's helper
ttresearch.page.GAS_REMOVER.0=After knowing both the Gaseous Illuminae and Tenebrae, you are thinking it's becoming a hassle to get rid of it. With this item, by shift-right clicking on it, all the nearby gas will get dissipated.

The button in the bottom controls if the tablet reacts always when it can or just when a redstone signal is applied.<BR><BR>Virtually anything can be animated, including blocks. The type of tool in the tablet also defines how fast something breaks, as expected.

ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_FLIGHT=Is this what they use in ALfheim?

# -- WAND FOCUS: DISLOCATION
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_DISLOCATION=Wand Focus: Dislocation
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_DISLOCATION=Now here, now there
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_DISLOCATION.0=You created a wand focus based on the focus of equal trade. The difference is that this one not only holds the object's fingerprint, but it holds the object itself, allowing it to be placed elsewhere.<BR><BR>To get a block to transport, right click on it. To place it back, right click somewhere else. This focus can transport pretty much anything, including chests and mob spawners.
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_DISLOCATION.1=The vis cost in applied in picking up the block. Placing it down is free.<BR><BR>Due to the amount of energy required for the dislocation, blocks with tile entities (such as chests and furnaces) cost 5x the amount of vis as normally.

ttresearch.page.MAGNETS.1=You designed two devices. The Kinetic and Corporeal Attractors, these, respectively affect items and living beings.<BR><BR>The Corporeal Attractor involves some more complex mechanisms, to which you can access by right clicking it with a casting wand.

# -- OSMOTIC ENCHANTER
ttresearch.name.ENCHANTER=Osmotic Enchanter
ttresearch.lore.ENCHANTER=Picking your luck
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.0=You grew tired of getting terrible enchantments for your efforts. To that, you created a new enchantment table that allows you to pick what enchantments you want to apply to an item.<BR><BR>This new contraption requires a wand, each enchantment requires a specific combination of vis from that wand. The price of the enchantment is exponentially proportional to the level you want to apply.<BR><BR>Regular enchantment rules apply, for example, you can't combine Silk Touch with Fortune.
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.1=After you selected the enchantments you want on an item, clicking the red button in the interface will start the enchanting progress. As the item is being enchanted, you can't take it out of the table, nor can you change the enchantments you are putting on it.<BR><BR>The table will slowly drain vis from the wand, until it's done. For this to work, there needs to be 6 pillars in the nearby vicinity (4 blocks), these pillars need to be at the same level of the table.<BR><BR>[continued]
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.2=The pillars need to be made of two to twelve Obsidian Totem blocks stacked on top of each other, with a piece of Nitor on top of them. The enchanter will get flux energy from them, grabbing vis from the wand and combining them to enchant the item.
