Welcome to the Thaumic Tinkerer Github Repo.

Thaumic Tinkerer is a Thaumcraft addon, it's intention is to add new content to Thaumcraft, and bring back some oldies, but goodies.

This mod is made with a Deobfuscated version of Thaumcraft, loaded as a Library. You can get a deobfuscated version of Thaumcraft using immibis' [Bearded Octo Nemesis](https://github.com/immibis/bearded-octo-nemesis). Remember that Thaumcraft is a closed-source mod, you can not decompile it, and I don't do so.
