 * which are implementations of specific languages (e.g. assembler). The built-
 * in ones are available as static fields in this class.
 * <p/>
 * Note that registration of architectures is optional and only intended as a
 * convenience feature to provide mods with a way to iterate available
 * architectures using {@link #architectures()}. Also note that any architecture
 * passed to {@link #create(li.cil.oc.api.machine.Owner, Class)} that has not
 * yet been registered will automatically be registered.
 * <p/>
 * Note that these methods should <em>not</em> be called in the pre-init phase,
 * since the {@link #instance} may not have been initialized at that time. Only
 * start calling these methods in the init phase or later.
