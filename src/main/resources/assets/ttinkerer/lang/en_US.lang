ttresearch.page.INTERFACE.0=The thing is, there's only six sides to a block..." - Direwolf20<BR><BR>Myth = Busted! Your latest construct can be bound to a block in the nearby vicinity.

It can accept BuildCraft, TE3 and IC2 power, essentia, items, and liquids, being able to also export the latter two.<BR>[continued]
ttresearch.page.INTERFACE.1=In order to bind an interface to another block, you need to create a special tool to do so. What you call the Transvector Binder should get the job done.<BR><BR>By simply right clicking on the interface followed by right clicking on the target, these two get bound and ready for operation. The limit is short, only 4 blocks. (Note: buildcraft pipes need to be broken and replaced to work)
ttresearch.page.INTERFACE.2=It's also possible, by right clicking this block with any other to camouflage it as the block held. To remove to cover, simply right click on the camouflaged block with an empty hand.

# -- GOLEM CONNECTOR

ttresearch.lore.GOLEM_CONNECTOR=No Golemic mind control involved. Honest!
ttresearch.page.GOLEM_CONNECTOR.0=By exploring what you can do with motion, tools, and a little bit of order, you have discovered how to make those golems just a tiny bit more obedient! You discover a block, that when you place a computer by it, can read the mind of golems nearby, and 'convince' them to do as the computer asks
ttresearch.page.GOLEM_CONNECTOR.1=In order to bind a Connector to a golem, you need to create a special tool to do so. What you call the Transvector Binder should get the job done.<BR><BR>By simply right clicking on the Connector followed by shift-right clicking on the target golem, these two get bound and ready for operation. The limit is quite long, 30 blocks away!

ttresearch.name.GASEOUS_LIGHT=Gaseous Illuminae
ttresearch.lore.GASEOUS_LIGHT=Bright out of sight
ttresearch.page.GASEOUS_LIGHT.0=You have studied the intricacies of the light, and found out a way to create completely invisible light by infusing a phial with the raw light.<BR><BR>This phial contains a concentrated extract of Gaseous Illuminae, that can be released through a right click, and will spread relatively fast in the nearby area, lighting it up.

# -- GASEOUS TENEBRAE
ttresearch.name.GASEOUS_SHADOW=Gaseous Tenebrae
ttresearch.lore.GASEOUS_SHADOW=A red handball?
ttresearch.page.GASEOUS_SHADOW.0=You have studied the intricacies of the Shadow, and found out a way to create gaseous darkness by infusing a phial with the raw shadow.<BR><BR>This phial contains a concentrated extract of Gaseous Tenebrae, that can be released through a right click, and will spread relatively fast in the nearby area, darkening it.

# -- FUME DISSIPATOR
ttresearch.name.GAS_REMOVER=Fume Dissipator
ttresearch.lore.GAS_REMOVER=Ryuuji's helper
ttresearch.page.GAS_REMOVER.0=After knowing both the Gaseous Illuminae and Tenebrae, you are thinking it's becoming a hassle to get rid of it. With this item, by shift-right clicking on it, all the nearby gas will get dissipated.

ttresearch.lore.ANIMATION_TABLET=I'm level 78...
ttresearch.page.ANIMATION_TABLET.0=You decided to further discover the uses of Golem Animation Cores, and this is the fruit of that labour.<BR><BR>This tablet can accept an item to animate with mystical energy. Using the left and right buttons in the tablet's interface, you can select to do a left or right click with the item. The button in the bottom controls if the tablet reacts always when it can or just when a redstone signal is applied.<BR><BR>Virtually anything can be animated, including blocks. The type of tool in the tablet also defines how fast something breaks, as expected.

# -- WAND FOCUS: UPRISING
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_FLIGHT=Wand Focus: Uprising
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_FLIGHT=Is this what they use in ALfheim?
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_FLIGHT.0=Using the knowledge you got from creating the Sword of the Zephyr of propelling things around with air, you created a wand focus that will propel the holder in the direction that they're looking at.<BR><BR>When someone is propelled through the use of this focus, any accumulated gravitational energy is negated, resetting the fall damage the holder would take.

# -- WAND FOCUS: DISLOCATION
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_DISLOCATION=Wand Focus: Dislocation
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_DISLOCATION=Build the castle within your mind so it never falls down
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_DISLOCATION.0=You created a wand focus based on the focus of equal trade. The difference is that this one not only holds the object's fingerprint, but it holds the object itself, allowing it to be placed elsewhere.<BR><BR>To get a block to transport, right click on it. To place it back, right click somewhere else. This focus can transport pretty much anything, including chests and mob spawners.
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_DISLOCATION.1=The vis cost in applied in picking up the block. Placing it down is free.<BR><BR>Due to the amount of energy required for the dislocation, blocks with tile entities (such as chests and furnaces) cost 5x the amount of vis as normally. Mob spawners, in particular, cost 20x instead.

# -- TALISMAN OF REMEDIUM
ttresearch.name.CLEANSING_TALISMAN=Talisman of Remedium
ttresearch.lore.CLEANSING_TALISMAN=Mitsukake's Gift
ttresearch.page.CLEANSING_TALISMAN.0=You have studied life and the body and found that through the application of magic you can protect yourself from harmful outside influences by redirecting these effects to a construct.

As expected, it only works whilst enabled.

# -- HYPERENERGETIC NITOR
ttresearch.name.BRIGHT_NITOR=Hyperenergetic Nitor
ttresearch.lore.BRIGHT_NITOR=Take that, Twilight!
ttresearch.page.BRIGHT_NITOR.0=You managed to create a light that will shine even if it's being carried by a player by energizing the everburning flame that is Nitor with powerful energetic aspects such as Potentia and Lux.<BR><BR>The light casted by this will shine closely behind the carrier, it seems to leave a longer trail in the Nether, due to the heat.

# -- WAND FOCUS: TELEKINESIS
ttresearch.name.FOCUS_TELEKINESIS=Wand Focus: Telekinesis
ttresearch.lore.FOCUS_TELEKINESIS=Beats gravity bubbles any day
ttresearch.page.FOCUS_TELEKINESIS.0=You created a wand focus that kinetically moves objects laying on the floor. This focus will move any nearby items to where you're pointing at. Sneaking will bring the items towards you instead.

# -- KINETIC ATTRACTION
ttresearch.name.MAGNETS=Kinetic Attraction
ttresearch.lore.MAGNETS=How do they work?
ttresearch.page.MAGNETS.0=Working with the telekinesis focus, you managed to apply this knowledge to create a device to attract items or living beings, like a magnet.<BR><BR>These two blocks have two states, north (red) and south (blue), in north mode it'll push items, or entities away; in south mode it'll pull them in.<BR><BR>The range of the attraction depends on the redstone signal applied to it. A lever next to it will allow for 7.5 blocks, while a current from farther away will make it shorter. In general, the attraction is equal to half the redstone signal's strength in blocks, in every direction.
ttresearch.page.MAGNETS.1=You designed two devices. The Kinetic and Corporeal Attractors, these, respectively affect items and living beings.<BR><BR>The Corporeal Attractor involves some more complex mechanisms, to which you can access by right clicking it with a casting wand. Using a Soul Mould, you can right click on a mob to save it as a pattern, which you can set in the attractor's interface, as a filter, along with settings for child or adult animals, if available.

# -- OSMOTIC ENCHANTER
ttresearch.name.ENCHANTER=Osmotic Enchanter
ttresearch.lore.ENCHANTER=Picking your luck
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.0=You grew tired of getting terrible enchantments for your efforts. To that, you created a new enchantment table that allows you to pick what enchantments you want to apply to an item.<BR><BR>This new contraption requires a wand, each enchantment requires a specific combination of vis from that wand. The price of the enchantment is exponentially proportional to the level you want to apply.<BR><BR>Regular enchantment rules apply, for example, you can't combine Silk Touch with Fortune.
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.1=After you selected the enchantments you want on an item, clicking the red button in the interface will start the enchanting progress. As the item is being enchanted, you can't take it out of the table, nor can you change the enchantments you are putting on it.<BR><BR>The table will slowly drain vis from the wand, until it's done. For this to work, there needs to be 6 pillars in the nearby vicinity (4 blocks), these pillars need to be at the same level of the table.<BR><BR>[continued]
ttresearch.page.ENCHANTER.2=The pillars need to be made of two to twelve Obsidian Totem blocks stacked on top of each other, with a piece of Nitor on top of them. The enchanter will get flux energy from them, grabbing vis from the wand and combining them to enchant the item.<BR><BR>Lastly, the enchanter will cease to function with iron or copper capped wands, due to them being too rustic and basic for the complex infusions required.

# -- TALISMAN OF WITHHOLD
ttresearch.name.XP_TALISMAN=Talisman of Withhold
ttresearch.lore.XP_TALISMAN=I'll take your 'time'
ttresearch.page.XP_TALISMAN.0=After knowing that Zombie Brains have the ability to store experience, you have created a talisman that mimics that behaviour, not to a perfect extent though.<BR><BR>To switch the ability to store experience, you need to shift-right-click on the talisman. When the talisman is enabled, it'll absorb any nearby experience orbs, those can be transformed back into usable experience by right clicking with a glass bottle in your inventory, turning that bottle into a Bottle o' Enchanting.

# -- ESSENTIA FUNNEL
ttresearch.name.FUNNEL=Essentia Funnel
ttresearch.lore.FUNNEL=Even transfer
ttresearch.page.FUNNEL.0=You grew tired of managing your jars with phials, to that, you created this new mechanism to transfer the contents of one into another.<BR><BR>By placing this block above a hopper, and right clicking it with a filled jar, if the hopper is pointing into a jar that's either empty or of the same aspect, the contents of the jar will be transferred over.

# -- ENCHANTMENT: ASCENT BOOST

ttresearch.lore.TTENCH_ASCENT_BOOST=Over Wall Maria
ttresearch.page.TTENCH_ASCENT_BOOST.0=You have formulated an enchantment that allows you to jump higher than you normally can.<BR><BR>This enchantment can be applied on leg armor. When done so, the wearer will be able to jump a lot higher than normal.

ttresearch.page.BLOOD_SWORD.0=You created a sword that strikes with unparalleled force.

ttresearch.page.REVEALING_HELM.0=As it turns out, goggles don't offer much protection from attacking zombies. You think you have a fix for that though. By strapping goggles of revealing onto a thaumium helmet, you can get the benefits of both. Well, it turns out it is a bit more complicated than that. A bit of magic is required to avoid feedback loops, and a bit of magic to keep them from slipping off, but on the whole, it more or less works.

ttresearch.name.LEVITATOR=Levitational Locomotive
ttresearch.lore.LEVITATOR=It moves to the left, it moves to the right.
ttresearch.page.LEVITATOR.0=You created a new contraption to move things back and forth. Two relays placed in a straight line will project a force beam between them.

ttresearch.lore.ICHOR_CLOTH=Life Fiber Synchronization
ttresearch.page.ICHOR_CLOTH.0=You found a way of infusing Magical Fabric with your latest discovery, Ichor. Funnily enough, this process does not require the typical infusion procedure, as the Ichor easily absorbs the diamond and blends with the fabric.<BR><BR>However, to do this, you require not only the best wand you ever designed to be fully charged, but you must also be wearing a full set of thaumaturge's robes, in order to convey enough energy for the creation.<BR><BR>You think it's time you start designing a new wand.

By infusing a silverwood wand core with Ichorcloth, you managed to create the ultimate wand core.<BR><BR>This core holds an insane amount of 1000 of each type of vis.
