thaumictinkerer.research.share_tome.title=Tome of Knowledge Sharing
thaumictinkerer.research.share_tome.lore=A Goldfish's Diary
thaumictinkerer.research.share_tome.0=If one day you happen to want to share your knowledge with the rest of the world, this is the item for you.<BR><BR>By simply right clicking on this tome and handing it to someone else, they'll get all the research you've discovered so far.<BR><BR>It only seems to be able to hold research you have completed however. (Note: Case there being no recipe on the right of this, the recipe is disabled and the item is creative only)

thaumictinkerer.research.funnel.title=Essentia Funnel
thaumictinkerer.research.funnel.lore=Even Transfer
thaumictinkerer.research.funnel.0=You grew tired of managing your jars with phials, to that, you created this new mechanism to transfer the contents of one into another.<BR><BR>By placing this block above a hopper, and right clicking it with a filled jar, if the hopper is pointing into a jar that's either empty or of the same aspect, the contents of the jar will be transferred over.

thaumictinkerer.research.cleaning_talisman.title=Talisman of Remedium
thaumictinkerer.research.cleaning_talisman.lore=Mitsukake's Gift
thaumictinkerer.research.cleaning_talisman.0=You have studied life and the body and after examining some poisons and cures, found that through the application of magic you can protect yourself from harmful outside influences by redirecting these effects to a construct. This talisman will dispel most harmful effects on the holder and keep them on itself, taking damage.<BR><BR>To enable or disable this ability, one would shift-right click on it. As expected, it only works whilst enabled. It must be worn in your amulet slot to take effect.

thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.title=Smokey Quartz
thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.lore=Shadow of the Day
thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.0=Smokey Quartz is pretty much Quartz, but negative. All regular blocks that can be made with quartz, can also be made with smokey quartz, and they look black.<BR><BR>Smokey Quartz itself can be made with a piece of coal or charcoal for tinting, and a few pieces of regular nether quartz.

thaumictinkerer.research.transvector_interface.title=Transvector Interface
thaumictinkerer.research.transvector_interface.0=The thing is, there's only six sides to a block..." - Direwolf20<BR><BR>Myth = Busted! Your latest construct can be bound to a block in the nearby vicinity. Its sides will mimic the sides of the block selected, and it'll function as an extension. It can accept BuildCraft, TE3 and IC2 power, essentia, items, and liquids, being able to also export the latter two.<BR>In order to bind an interface to another block, you need to create a special tool to do so. What you call the Transvector Binder should get the job done.<BR><BR>By simply right clicking on the interface followed by right clicking on the target, these two get bound and ready for operation. The limit is short, usually only 4 blocks. (Note: buildcraft pipes need to be broken and replaced to work)It's also possible, by right clicking this block with any other to camouflage it as the block held. To remove to cover, simply right click on the camouflaged block with an empty hand.
