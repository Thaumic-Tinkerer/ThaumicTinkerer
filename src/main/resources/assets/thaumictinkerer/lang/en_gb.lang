thaumictinkerer.research.share_tome.title=Tome of Knowledge Sharing
thaumictinkerer.research.share_tome.lore=A Goldfish's Diary
thaumictinkerer.research.share_tome.0=While exploring the magic of the Thaumonomicon one evening I started pondering about the knowledge within, and how it is all in this one, easilly lost, not shareable book.  It seems anyone I teach to make a Thaumonomicon makes either a blank one or, if they are a practioner, one which contains their own knowledge. After some minor experimentation, I found that if I write with special ink, I can make a tome that will transfer the completed knowledge of one Thaumonomicon to another practioners's Thaumonomicon. Uncompleted research seems to be resistant to this method of transfer.

thaumictinkerer.research.funnel.title=Essentia Funnel
thaumictinkerer.research.funnel.lore=Even Transfer
thaumictinkerer.research.funnel.0=I grew tired of managing my jars with phials, and tubes seem to be a bit esoteric still for my tastes, although I will need to explore their use for later. If I use the thaumically conductive properties of Thaumium in some shaped stone I can make a cover for a hopper, allowing it to transfer essentia from one jar to another, as if they were chests.

thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.title=Smokey Quartz
thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.lore=Shadow of the Day
thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.0=Quartz is a lovely material to work with, but I have found that it is just a tiny bit too bright for my liking. Can I make it more useful?
thaumictinkerer.research.black_quartz.1=If I use some coal or charcoal and fuse it with quartz, I end up with a smokey quartz that can make all the regular quartz blocks, but looks much darker and satisfying to use, it also appears to have unlocked a few more thaumic uses as well. Part of me wonders if this would make a good hunting weapon if I attached a string


thaumictinkerer.research.transvector_interface.title=Transvector Interface
thaumictinkerer.research.transvector_interface.0=A man who’s name is only known as Direwolf20, once said “The thing is, there's only six sides to a block...”. This knowledge has been the Thaumaturge’s bane for many years, as there is never enough sides to attach everything we want to attach. If my new dissimulation blocks can look like a block, I wonder if they can act like it too, combined with the displacement effects of ender pearls I may be able to break this bane.
thaumictinkerer.research.transvector_interface.1=A man who’s name is only known as Direwolf20, once said “The thing is, there's only six sides to a block...”. ... I think I can now say that myth is busted. I can bind this new interface to a nearby block, and it will effectively bind the two points in space.<BR>Although it may look seperate to the naked eye, pipes, wires, and other mechanics, both thaumic, and mundane, will interact with the interface block as if they were touching the linked block itself.<BR> I simply have to select the interface with my specially constructed beacon device, to link the two, then select the block I wish linked with the beacon, and then the two blocks are linked, until one or the other is removed. The interface even retains the camouflage ability of the dissimulation block.<BR> It's effects seem very much like the mirrors, I wonder what happens if I add the base glass?
thaumictinkerer.research.transvector_interface.2=A man who’s name is only known as Direwolf20, once said “The thing is, there's only six sides to a block...”. ... I think I can now say that myth is busted. I can bind this new interface to a nearby block, and it will effectively bind the two points in space.<BR>Although it may look seperate to the naked eye, pipes, wires, and other mechanics, both thaumic, and mundane, will interact with the interface block as if they were touching the linked block itself.<BR> I simply have to select the interface with my specially constructed beacon device, to link the two, then select the block I wish linked with the beacon, and then the two blocks are linked, until one or the other is removed. The interface even retains the camouflage ability of the dissimulation block.<BR><BR> I now also have the Transvector Dislocator too. The addition of the magical mirror base seems to strengten the effect, letting me swap two points in space at command. All I have to do is bind a block to the Dislocator, then on a redstone signal it swaps it with the block in front of the dislocator.

thaumictinkerer.research.form_revealer.title=Multiblock Guide
thaumictinkerer.research.form_revealer.0=As I learn more about Thaumaturgy, I find that my workings no longer always fit inside one block, sometimes structures taller then myself even, are needed to be constructed to complete my tasks. If I take the basic memory provided from a zombie’s brain, and combine it with the phantasmal light of nitor, I may be able to make a wand that will remember where I need to place blocks, to complete a structure, and show me which block I need to provide in whichever places they need to go.

thaumictinkerer.research.TT_TELEKENESIS.title=Telekinesis
thaumictinkerer.research.TT_TELEKENESIS.0=After watching how creatures and items alike drift in water I started to wonder, what if I had a stream of magical energy that could do so?
thaumictinkerer.research.TT_TELEKENESIS.1=I have managed to create a focal pattern that creates a light stream of magic infused with vis,  if I add this pattern to a bolt and right click on the ground, all nearby items will float towards that point. Crouching will instead cause the items to flee from that point.

thaumictinkerer.research.TT_DISLOCATE.title=Dislocation
thaumictinkerer.research.DISLOCATE.0=After so much work was put into discovering how to exchange blocks, I noticed sometimes there would be a delay before the block appears when being swapped. I wonder what would happen if I look into this more?
thaumictinkerer.research.DISLOCATE.1=Success! After some experimentation, many lost blocks of cobblestone, and an invasion of endermen or two,  I substituted permutatio for desiderium, so the effect desired to hold on longer, and now I have a pattern that can temporarily store blocks to move them. <BR> Once applied to a focus, left click on a block to store it within the focus, then left click again to place the block.

thaumictinkerer.research.prismarine.title=Aquatic Alchemy

thaumictinkerer.research.spellbinding_cloth.title=Spellbinding Cloth
thaumictinkerer.research.spellbinding_cloth.lore=The sad palmtop thaumaturge
thaumictinkerer.research.spellbinding_cloth.0=While working with my enchanted axe one day, I accidentally dropped it in a cauldron of concentrated magic. The axe, of course, was lost, but I noticed the first thing to go was the enchantment glow, leaving it a plain metal axe before it dissolved. <BR> I wonder what would happen if I coated some Enchanted cloth in this mixture and just wiped a tool down with it?
thaumictinkerer.research.spellbinding_cloth.1=My experiments have born fruit, Enchanted fabric soaked in the mixture will wipe an enchantment off an item, leaving it pristine and ready for re-enchantment. It seems to damage the cloth slightly each time, however.

thaumictinkerer.research.dissimulation.title=Dissimulation Block
thaumictinkerer.research.dissimulation.0=This new substance called Prismarine seems to have some unusual optical properties. I wonder what I could do once I have fully investigated it.
thaumictinkerer.research.dissimulation.1=After fully investigating Prismarine, I have found a way to make blocks that with a magical push, can look like any other block. <BR> All I have to do is place this Dissimulation block down, and then touch another block against it by right clicking. I wonder if I can use this apparent memory of another block in any other ways?



thaumictinkerer.research.repairer.title=Thaumic Restorer
thaumictinkerer.research.repairer.0=After finding out one mixture of Essentia could disenchant, but damage tools, I started to wonder, could another fix them? <BR> Turns out it can. If I take my new Thaumic Restorer and put the tool in, then pump in the correct Essentia for the tool, it will let the tool regain it's natural durability. It's handy that the ever-useful goggles let me see which type is needed.

thaumictinkerer.research.magnet.title=Thaumic Magnents
thaumictinkerer.research.magnet.0=Putting a focus containing my new telekenesis effect into a framework of greatwood and iron ,I get a device that attracts or repels items dependent on the redstone signal. With some clever adjustment, I can also filter which items it should attract or repel. <BR> I get the feeling there is a way to magnify this pull, to effect more then just dropped items.
thaumictinkerer.research.magnet.1=Putting a focus containing my new telekenesis effect into a framework of greatwood and iron ,I get a device that attracts or repels items dependent on the redstone signal. With some clever adjustment, I can also filter which items it should attract or repel. <BR> Substituting iron for thaumium, and adding more vis, seems to magnify the effect, not items now, but creatures will be attracted or repeled. I obviously can't place a creature in the device to filter it, but I can catch the essence of their soul using a modified ender pearl, and that seems to do just as well a filter.

thaumictinkerer.research.enchanter.title=Osmotic Enchanter
thaumictinkerer.research.enchanter.0=Infusion seems more familiar the more I look at it. Something about how it pulls in magic and infuses such a large amount into an object to give it new properties makes me think it could be related to enchantment of an item in some way. If I investigate infusion more I wonder if I can find the link?
thaumictinkerer.research.enchanter.1=I have found the link between infusion and enchantment! Whereas infusing an object requires a massive amount of different essentia, enchantment, being a lower power infusing, doesnt need much more then the basic ambient magic. Working off of this theory, I can build an enchanting table that uses a similar setup to the infusion matrix, to instead add enchantment to a tool, while being able to select which magic settles on the tool, meaning I can select the enchantment. Building this structure, then triggering it by sprinkling some salis mundus should work

thaumictinkerer.research.tablet.title=Dynamism Tablet
thaumictinkerer.research.tablet.0=Golems are so very useful, watching them wandering here and there to do my bidding is quite amusing. However, sometimes I don't want a minion doing something for me. Sometimes, I just need a plain block that does one thing, but does it well. The way I built a magnet around a focus makes me wonder: can I build something around a seal? I must examine golems more.
thaumictinkerer.research.tablet.1=It looks like I can build a block around a seal that leverages golemancy to use an item, without actually being a fully mobile golem. If I place this block down and give it an item, it will use the item on the block in front of it. That is, as long as it has a redstone signal. ` It can be told whether to mine or use a block. However, with no inventory, anything it does mine drops into the world - perhaps for its more mobile cousin to pick up.

thaumictinkerer.research.energetic_nitor.title=Hyperenergetic Nitor
thaumictinkerer.research.energetic_nitor.0=One cannot deny the Nitor is useful. However, having to place it down before I see anything is annoying. I wonder, could I somehow make it visible from my palm if I were to make it more energetic?
thaumictinkerer.research.energetic_nitor.1=Adding in more Energy and Light Essentia seems to have done the trick. I have managed to create a more powerful nitor - this Hyperenergetic Nitor burns with a visible light from my hand, so much so that it will even leave a trail as I move.
