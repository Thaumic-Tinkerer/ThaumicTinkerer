 * Components are nodes that can be addressed computers via drivers.
 * <p/>
 * Components therefore form a sub-network in the overall network, and some
 * special rules apply to them. For one, components specify an additional
 * kind of visibility. Component visibility may have to differ from real
 * network reachability in some cases, such as network cards (which have to
 * be able to communicate across the whole network, but computers should only
 * "see" the cards installed directly in them).
 * <p/>
 * Unlike the {@link li.cil.oc.api.network.Node}'s network reachability, this is a dynamic value and
 * can be changed at any time. For example, this is used to hide multi-block
 * screen parts that are not the origin from computers in the network.
 * <p/>
 * The method responsible for dispatching network messages from computers also
 * only allows sending messages to components that the computer can see,
 * according to the component's visibility. Therefore nodes won't receive
 * messages from computer's that should not be able to see them.
